The updater script
==================

When this script is run, it downloads list of packages and upgrades the system
based on the list.

It can handle lists of packages individual to the given device and individual
encrypted packages.

The URL of the repository and of the package list is hardcoded at the top of
the script.

The repository layout
---------------------

Assume that `$ID` is the serial number of the device in question. The
`$BASE_URL` is the top level of the repository structure.

The list for the device is located as `$BASE_URL/lists/$ID`. If that one does
not exist, the updater script takes a generic one, at
`$BASE_URL/lists/generic`.

An unencrypted package is located at address
`$BASE_URL/packages/<packagename>-<packageversion>.ipk`. An encrypted one is at
`$BASE_URL/packages/<packagename>-<packageversion>-$ID.ipk`.

Note that the repository may contain packages in multiple versions.

The package list format
-----------------------

Each line represents one package. The format of the line is:

  <package-name>	<version>	<flags>

The columns are separated by one tab. The version is the version that should be
installed on the device.

Flags represent special properties of the package. Each one is an on-off
switch. Each flag is single letter, all of them are concatenated together.

E::
  The package is encrypted and individual for the given device.
R::
  Instead of installing the package, the package should be removed from the
  system. The version should be `-` in this case.
F::
  Force re-installation even if it is in current version.

Dependencies
------------

Dependencies are not considered on the device. The list is processed from top
to bottom, one line at a time. If one package depends on another, it should be
listed in the list above the another.

Example
-------

This is an example of the package list that includes ucollect with its all
dependencies and removes nuci.

  libgcc	4.6-linaro-1	
  libc	0.9.33.2-1	
  libpcap	1.1.1-2	
  libpthread	0.9.33.2-1	
  librt	0.9.33.2-1	
  libopenssl	1.0.1e-1	
  zlib	1.2.7-1
  libuci	2013-05-02.1-1	
  ucollect	14	E
  nuci	-	R
